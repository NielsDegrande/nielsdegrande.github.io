      <h1>Travel planning with Comet</h1>
      <div class="blog-date">Published on October 7, 2025</div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          No, this blog post is not about interstellar travel.
          Earlier this week, we all got access to <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/comet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perplexity Comet</a>.
          A few weeks before, I finally got off the waitlist for <a href="https://strawberrybrowser.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Strawberry</a> and already had a first taste of agentic browsers.
          Therefore, I was very excited to try out Comet too.
        </p>

        <h2>Benchmarking</h2>
        <p>
          The benchmark exercise I have used for agentic browsers so far (Operator, Strawberry, and now Comet) is to put all ingredients for a lasagna in the shopping basket of my local supermarket chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anecdotally, Comet and I started off on the wrong foot.
          After some onboarding screens where I chose not to import bookmarks or share my data, I saw a button labeled "Try assistant."
          Expecting to see a chat box, I was confused to only see example prompts.
          I escaped and looked around, then clicked "Try assistant" again.
          Still no luck.
          Once more I escaped, stared at the screen, then noticed the "Assistant" button next to the URL bar.
          I have no idea who thinks it is good UI/UX to have a button "Try assistant" that does not take you to the assistant, nor point you to where to find the assistant.
          Perplexity, do better!
        </p>
        <img class="blog-img spaced" src="../assets/blog/travel-planning-with-comet/try-assistant.png" alt="'Try assistant' without opening the assistant">
        <p>
          Once I got past the initial confusion, I had two observations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The speed is incredible.</li>
          <li>It did the task perfectly.
            While others get stuck on cookie banners, Comet had no issues whatsoever.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given that I do not pay, I was impressed that I did not feel like I had to sacrifice either speed or accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>Travel planning</h2>
        <p>
          I did not switch to Comet for my primary browser.
          I am quite invested in being privacy-first, using LibreWolf as my daily driver.
          As I am about to embark on a big trip, I have to book 10+ hotels.
          Typically, this is a very time-consuming task.
          You find yourself clicking through Booking.com, copying and double-checking the dates, repeating the same filters over and over again, etc.
          Dreading this task, I figured: let's give Comet a try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having researched my trip with ChatGPT, I asked it to summarize a nice table with all the facts.
          I copied and pasted the table into Comet's Assistant and asked it to open a browser tab for each hotel location and set the filters (budget, minimum rating, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>Observations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It parallelized all locations, and I could nicely follow the progress in the assistant window.</li>
          <li>It took a bit of time, and potentially reasoned more than required, but got the job done with about 90% accuracy.</li>
          <li>It did not open the browser tabs at first, rather showed "mini-tabs" in the chat window.
            However, when I asked it to open the tabs, it did so nicely, showing proper bidirectional integration between the browser and the browser agent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Examples of where it was not accurate: for one hotel location, it had the dates right but repeated the location from another row in the table.
          Comet did a great job of ordering the browser tabs by date, even though the ChatGPT output was prioritized by which locations to book first given likelihood to sell out.
          I liked that Comet reordered the tabs, as it allowed me to quickly validate if I had any gaps.
          The wrong location therefore stood out, as it was jumping countries too soon.
          If not for that, I might have realized the mistake when it was too late.
          Good thing I did not give it my credit card just yet!
        </p>
        <p>
          The other shortcoming (one could argue it was only laziness) was that, upon Booking.com returning no results for a national park with no hotels inside, it did not try to search nearby villages just outside the park.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          For a tool I do not pay for, I am incredibly impressed.
          I can already see how this will save me so much time with form filling and booking tasks.
          While the booking for many locations is quite expensive usage already, I did not hit any limits or run out of tokens yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, not paying for it makes me a little worried too.
          If you do not pay for a product, you are the product.
          I am quite OK giving Perplexity (and whoever buys or uses their data) insight into my travel habits, but what else am I giving up in the free plan?
          Is my data "safer" if I would pay for it?
          What if I would have it fill out my visa application forms?
          A lot of questions, and few precise answers in the FAQ.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next on my list was booking several car rentals.
          I did not think twice about using Comet.
          I am hooked; there is no way back to doing things the old way.
          Can I imagine paying for this?
          Yes, a couple of euros a month, easy.
