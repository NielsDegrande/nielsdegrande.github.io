# HTML

## Paragraph Formatting

When formatting HTML content, especially for blog posts, follow this specific structure for paragraph tags:

```html
<p>
  First sentence of the paragraph.
  Second sentence continues on a new line.
  Each sentence gets its own line with proper indentation.
</p>
```
